 ANSWER 1. Relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities:
In the given diagram, the likely relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a many-to-one relationship. This means that each product in the "Product" table can belong to one specific category in the "Product_Category" table. The relationship is established through a foreign key in the "Product" table that references the primary key in the "Product_Category" table.

 ANSWER 2. Ensuring each product has a valid category:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can set up a foreign key constraint in the database schema. The foreign key in the "Product" table should reference the primary key in the "Product_Category" table. This constraint will enforce referential integrity, ensuring that each product points to a valid category.
